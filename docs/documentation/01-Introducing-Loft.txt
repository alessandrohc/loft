Chapter 01 - Introducing Loft
=============================

A description of Loft and its components. Motivations and characteristics of
the modules.

What is Loft?
-------------

Loft is a object persistence framework and an object manipulation toolkit.

The primary purpose of Loft is to establish a standard interface for both
accessing objects from their persistent repository and for writing repository
providers.A repository can be a relational database, the network, a set of
files on the filesystem, a directory server or any other form of data
persistence.

Support for different types of repositories are implemented on persistence
providers. Most of them can provide all you need to access objects in your
application, but Loft allows for you to write your own provider, adding your own
tweaks and optimizing for extenden functionality or better performance.

##Loft provides tools for building real-world applications in Lua
